// Type definitions
interface CodeActionProvider

// Regex patterns
/API_KEY\s*=\s*["']|api_key\s*=\s*["']/i
```

---

### 5. **Software Architecture & Design Patterns**
#### **Must Know:**
- Separation of concerns
- Provider pattern (CodeActionProvider)
- Factory pattern (creating different fix types)
- Strategy pattern (AI vs Manual fixes)
- Observer pattern (file change detection)
- Command pattern (VS Code commands)

#### **Your Architecture:**
```
Extension Entry ‚Üí Diagnostic Provider ‚Üí Code Action Provider ‚Üí AI/Manual Fixers
```

#### **Interview Questions:**
- "Explain your extension's architecture"
- "How do you handle different types of security fixes?"
- "Why did you separate AI fixes from manual fixes?"
- "How would you scale this to support more languages?"

---

### 6. **Performance & Optimization**
#### **Must Know:**
- Asynchronous processing for scanning
- Debouncing file change events
- Memory management in extensions
- Network request optimization
- Caching strategies
- Background vs foreground processing

#### **Performance Considerations:**
- File scanning on save (not on every keystroke)
- AI API call optimization
- Response caching
- Fallback to manual fixes for speed

---

### 7. **Testing & Quality Assurance**
#### **Must Know:**
- Unit testing patterns
- Integration testing for extensions
- Mock API responses
- Test-driven development
- Validation strategies
- Error scenario testing

#### **Your Testing Strategy:**
- Manual fix validation (100% reliability)
- AI response validation
- Multi-layer quality checks
- Fallback mechanism testing

## üé™ Demonstration Skills

### **Live Demo Preparation:**
1. **Setup Demo Environment:**
   ```bash
   # Quick demo setup
   code clean-test.js
   # Show vulnerabilities appearing
   # Demonstrate fixes working
   ```

2. **Key Demo Points:**
   - Real-time vulnerability detection
   - AI vs Manual fix comparison
   - Fix quality and speed
   - Error handling gracefully

3. **Talking Points:**
   - "This shows hybrid approach: AI intelligence + manual reliability"
   - "Notice the fallback when AI fails"
   - "Response time is 1-3 seconds for AI, instant for manual"
