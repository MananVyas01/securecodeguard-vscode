## ðŸ“‹ Remaining Tasks for Publishing

### Icon Setup
1. Convert `icon.svg` to PNG format (128x128 pixels recommended)
2. Add `"icon": "icon.png"` to package.json
3. Ensure icon meets VS Code marketplace guidelines

### Version & Publishing
1. Update version in package.json when ready to publish
2. Add license file (MIT recommended)
3. Test extension in clean VS Code environment

### GitHub Repository Setup

1. **Initialize Git Repository:**
```bash
cd "c:\Users\vyasm\Desktop\Stealth\vs-secure-code-plugin"
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: SecureCodeGuard VS Code Extension"
```

2. **Create GitHub Repository:**
   - Go to GitHub and create new repository named "securecodeguard-vscode"
   - Set as public repository
   - Don't initialize with README (we already have one)

3. **Push to GitHub:**
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/MananVyas01/securecodeguard-vscode.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

4. **Add GitHub Topics:**
   - vscode-extension
   - security
   - semgrep
   - developer-tools
   - static-analysis
   - typescript
   - security-scanner
   - vulnerability-detection

### Final Verification

## ðŸ“¦ Publishing Commands

When ready to publish to VS Code Marketplace:

```bash

npm install -g vsce

# Package the extension
vsce package

# Publish to marketplace (requires publisher account)
vsce publish
```

## ðŸš€ Final Commit

git add .
git commit -m "Phase 9: Final polish - documentation, demo plan, and project finalization"
git push
```

The SecureCodeGuard extension is now production-ready with:
