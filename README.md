# SecureCodeGuard - A VS Code Security Extension

SecureCodeGuard is a developer-friendly VS Code plugin that scans your code and highlights potential security risks as you work. It provides inline warnings, fix suggestions, and automatic re-scans to help you write safer code.

## Features

- **Real-time Security Scanning**: Detects hardcoded secrets like API keys or credentials
- **Authorization Checks**: Identifies routes or controller functions lacking authorization middleware
- **Dependency Analysis**: Scans `package.json` and `requirements.txt` for outdated or vulnerable dependencies
- **Quick Fixes**: Offers one-click fixes through VS Code's Code Actions (lightbulb)
- **AI-Powered Fixes**: Intelligent security refactoring using OpenAI GPT-3.5 or Groq Llama3
- **Scan Intelligence**: Tracks security metrics, fix rates, and provides analytics
- **Automatic Re-validation**: Re-runs scans automatically after code fixes

## How It Works

- Listens for file save events inside the editor
- Runs Semgrep rules on supported files (JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Java, C#)
- Uses VS Code's Diagnostics API to display warnings inline and in the Problems tab
- Suggests fixes through contextual actions or popup dialogs

## Example Security Issues Detected

- `api_key = "12345"` ‚Üí Suggest using `process.env.API_KEY` or `os.getenv("API_KEY")`
- `app.get('/admin', ...)` ‚Üí Flags missing `auth` or `isAdmin` middleware
- `"express": "1.2.0"` ‚Üí Alerts that a newer, more secure version is available
- `document.innerHTML = userInput` ‚Üí Warns about XSS vulnerability, suggests `textContent`
- `eval(userCode)` ‚Üí Detects code injection risk, suggests safer alternatives

## Supported Languages & Frameworks

### Languages
- JavaScript
- TypeScript  
- Python
- Java
- C#

### Frameworks
- **Express.js**: Route authorization detection
- **Flask**: Decorator-based authorization checks
- **Node.js**: Package dependency analysis
- **Python**: Requirements dependency analysis

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- VS Code 1.60.0 or higher
- [Semgrep](https://semgrep.dev/docs/getting-started/) installed

```bash
pip install semgrep
```

### Run Locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MananVyas01/securecodeguard-vscode.git
cd securecodeguard-vscode
npm install
code .
# Press F5 to launch the Extension Development Host
```

### Usage

1. **Configure AI Services (Optional):**
   - **VS Code Settings**: `Ctrl+Shift+P` ‚Üí "Preferences: Open Settings" ‚Üí Search "SecureCodeGuard"
   - **Environment File**: Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add your API keys
   - Set OpenAI and/or Groq API keys for AI-powered fixes
   
2. **Scan for Security Issues:**
   - Open any supported code file in VS Code
   - Save the file to trigger automatic security scanning
   - Review security issues in the Problems tab or inline diagnostics

3. **Apply Fixes:**
   - Click the lightbulb icon (üí°) for quick fixes
   - Choose between manual fixes or AI-powered solutions
   - Watch automatic re-scan confirm resolution

4. **View Analytics:**
   - Run `SecureCodeGuard: View Security Statistics` from Command Palette
   - Track fix rates, issue types, and scan history

## AI-Powered Security Intelligence

### AI Fix Engines
- **OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo**: Advanced reasoning for complex security refactoring
- **Groq Llama3**: Fast, efficient AI fixes with excellent code understanding
- **Smart Issue Detection**: Automatically identifies issue types for targeted AI prompts

### Scan Metrics & Analytics
- **Fix Rate Tracking**: Monitor percentage of issues resolved
- **Issue Type Analytics**: Understand your most common security patterns
- **AI vs Manual Fixes**: Compare effectiveness of different fix methods
- **Scan History**: Track security improvements over time
- **Export Data**: Export metrics for reporting and analysis

### Configuration
Set your AI API keys using one of these methods:

**Option 1: VS Code Settings (Recommended)**
```json
{
  "secureCodeGuard.openaiApiKey": "your-openai-key",
  "secureCodeGuard.groqApiKey": "your-groq-key"
}
```

**Option 2: Environment Variables (.env file)**
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Add your API keys:
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-api-key-here
GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_your-groq-api-key-here
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Security Note:** Never commit `.env` files with real API keys to version control!

## Security Patterns Detected

### Code Vulnerabilities
- Hardcoded API keys, passwords, and authentication tokens
- XSS vulnerabilities from unsafe DOM manipulation
- Code injection risks from eval() and dynamic execution
- Insecure randomization in security contexts
- SQL injection patterns from unsafe query construction

### Framework Security
- Missing authentication middleware in Express.js routes
- Missing authorization decorators in Flask routes
- Unprotected API endpoints and admin routes

### Dependency Security
- Outdated packages with known vulnerabilities
- Packages with documented CVEs
- Version analysis for potentially vulnerable dependencies
